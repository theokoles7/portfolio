      <p class="sec-content">
        Thank you for visiting! Here, you'll be able to find updates and write-ups about my latest projects, how I made them, and improvements that I'm planning/implementing for them. My goal is for this site to serve as not only a showcase of my work, but to provide inspiration, and hopefully even impart knowledge, to anyone interested in coding.
